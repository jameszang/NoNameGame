# Nutri-up!
We decided to focus on nutrition education through this healthy eating survival game. You as the avatar will have to maintain optimal levels of various nutrients and minerals each day by buying and consuming the appropriate foods. Each type of food you consume will change your nutrient metrics (eg. increasing your vitamin C bar). Remain in the optimal range at all times to avoid deficiency or toxicity symptoms, which will give you health debuffs! Random events (such as developing an allergy or discovery of your lactose intolerance) may occur throughout the gameplay, and will limit what you can consume in game. Other features in the game include exercising to increase stamina, visiting the doctor for tips on how to deal with any illnesses, restaurants to fulfill all your nutrient needs, visiting the grocery store to buy more food, and dumpster diving to find ... interesting things. Can you eat healthy for 30 days?
